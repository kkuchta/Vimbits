The high-level todo list can be found on [the vimbits trello board](https://trello.com/b/tp4Tdn3O).  Bug reports and whatnot can be viewed/added on the [github issues](https://github.com/kkuchta/Vimbits/issues) page.

Currently, Vimbits.com allows for searching by tag, and that assumes that the user 
tagged the bit well. Instead of relying on this assumption, it should be possible 
to internally search on the title attribute of the bit.
